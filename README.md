Develop AI Chatbot for Mental Health Detection

Create an AI-powered chatbot that can detect
early signs of depression, anxiety, or stress
through text and voice analysis.

Mental health issues often go undiagnosed due to stigma 
and lack of awareness. An AI chatbot can analyze text 
messages, voice tone, and speech patterns to detect 
emotional distress. It should provide personalized coping 
mechanisms, mindfulness exercises, and suggest seeking 
professional help if needed.
